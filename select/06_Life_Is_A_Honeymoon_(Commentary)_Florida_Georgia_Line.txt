This is Big Machine Radio
Celebrating Florida Georgia Line's brand new album, Dig Your Roots
And the guys say after getting married,
Of course, their wives have had an influence
On their lives and their songs

Ya know being that we're songwriters and artists
And we really try to be transparent with our lives
And where we're at
We really try to- we just write real music
And I think it's as a natural progression
Yes, our wives, and our love lives really in this album
This is the first album where BK and I have both been married men
And really, it's come through because we've
Been writing songs for the last couple years
We've been writing songs about the love of our lives
So, ya know, it's pretty obvious
But, like I said
We really try to still put out music that's a little bit for everybody
Ya know, and there's somethin' that
Everybody can get out of every song
And so, whether it's a love ballad
Or a love rock song, or whatever, definitely-
I would definitley say that our

Here's one in particular that definitely reflects how happy
Both Brian and Tyler are in their marriages
It's called Life is a Honeymoon
