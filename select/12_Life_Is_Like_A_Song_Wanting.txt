Do you know the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you say "I'd love to"
It makes me feel alive
Do you know the way you run your fingers through my hair
And I am with you now
Life is like a
Life is like a song
Sing along
On and on and on it lingers on
Come along
Piece together phrases in a funny way
Life is like a song
It was a rainy day
I got you on the phone
How do you do?
It's been a while or two
A while or two
Suddenly the clouds had disappeared

Love is kind, love is blind
I don't mind being your lover's fool
Life is like a
Life is like a song
Sing along
On and on and on it lingers on
Come along
Piece together phrases in a funny way
Hey life is like a song
Oh, life is like a song
Life is like a song
It has its ups and downs
Life is like a song
And it carries us on, oh

It's like a song
On and on and on
Oh, life is like a song
And it has its ups and downs
And it carries us on, oh
Life is like a
Life is like a
Life is like a
Life is like a
A-a-a song
