Woo!
Hmm, yeah

Life's like a road that you travel on
There's one day here and the next day gone
Sometimes you bend, sometimes you stand
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind
There's a world outside every darkened door
Where blues won't haunt you anymore
Where the brave are free, and lovers soar
Come ride with me to the distant shore

We won't hesitate to break down the garden gate
There's not much time left today yeah

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long

Through all these cities and all these towns
It's in my blood and it's all around
I love you now like I loved you then
This is the road and these are the hands
From Mozambique to the Memphis nights
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights
They knock me down, I'm back up again
You're in my blood, I'm not a lonely man

There's no load I can't hold
The roads are rough, this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell them we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long (all night long)
A gimme gimme gimme gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (hmm, yeah)
If you're going my way (if you're going my way)
I want to drive it all night long (all night long)

There was a distance between you and I (between you and I)
A misunderstanding once, but now we look it in the eye
Ooh, yeah (Hmm, yeah)

There ain't no load that I can't hold
The roads are rough this I know
I'll be there when the light comes in
Tell them we're survivors

Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long (all night long, yeah)
If you're going my way
I want to drive it all night long
A gimme gimme gimme, a gimme gimme, yeah
Life is a highway (life is a highway)
I want to ride it all night long (Woo, yeah)
If you're going my way (if you're going my way)
I want to drive it all night long (all night long, yeah)
Come on, a gimme gimme, gimme gimme gimme, yeah
Life is a highway
I want to ride it all night long
Yeah, I wanna drive it all night long, baby
If you're going my way (if you're going my way)
I want to drive it all night long (all night long)
